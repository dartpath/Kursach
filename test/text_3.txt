Chapter One

Smoke

Anselm Holland came to Jefferson many years ago. Where from, no one knew. 
But he was young then and a man of parts, or of presence at least, because 
within three years he had married the only daughter of a man who owned two 
thousand acres of some of the best land in the county, and he went to live 
in his father-in-law's house, where two years later his wife bore him twin 
sons and where a few years later still the father-in-law died and left Holland 
in full possession of the property, which was now in his wife's name. But even 
before that event, we in Jefferson had already listened to him talking a trifle 
more than loudly of "my land, my crops"; and those of us whose fathers and grandfathers 
had been bred here looked upon him a little coldly and a little askance for a ruthless 
man and (from tales told about him by both white and negro tenants and by others with 
whom he had dealings) for a violent one. But out of consideration for his wife and 
respect for his father-in-law, we treated him with courtesy if not with regard. So 
when his wife, too, died while the twin sons were still children, we believed that h
e was responsible, that her life had been worn out by the crass violence of an underbred 
outlander. And when his sons reached maturity and first one and then the other left home 
for good and all, we were not surprised. And when one day six months ago he was found dead, 
his foot fast in the stirrup of the saddled horse which he rode, and his body pretty badly 
broken where the horse had apparently dragged him through a rail fence (there still showed at 
the time on the horse's back and flanks the marks of the blows which he had dealt it in one of 
his fits of rage), there was none of us who was sorry, because a short time before that he had 
committed what to men of our town and time and thinking was the unpardonable outrage.
